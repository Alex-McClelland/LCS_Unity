      <text>The FBI investigation into the Conservative Crime Squad's government connections has led to the arrest of more than a dozen elected officials and revealed extensive corruption in law enforcement. "The uphevals in the police force, and arrest of corrupt officials, are only the beginning," FBI Chief Roberta T. Malton said during a news conference. "A major focus of our efforts will be on the complete destruction of the Conservative Crime Squad. Within six months, we'll have their entire leadership, dead or alive. I personally guarantee it."</text>

      <headline>RAIDS END CCS</headline>
      <text>An elite FBI force conducted simultaneous raids on several suspected Conservative Crime Squad safehouses in the early hours. Despite resistance from CCS terrorists armed with automatic weapons and body armor, no FBI agents were killed in the raids, and all three raids were successful. Seventeen suspects were killed in the fighting, and twenty-three are now in custody. The Conservative Crime Squad fell on hard times when the alternative newspaper Liberal Guardian published 1147 pages of documents showing extensive government support for the group. The ensuing scandal led to the arrest of twenty-five members of Congress, as well as several leadership figures in the Conservative Party's National Committee. "I want parents to rest easy tonight, " FBI Chief Roberta T. Malton said during a news conference to announce the raids. "You don't need the Liberal Crime Squad to protect you. The Government can handle it."</text>
