<!-- IMPORTANT NOTE: Keys are case sensitive, and must be unique within a set. The keys will be created based on the translation_set prefix + the specific key separated by an underscore.
eg. the actual translation key that will be referenced by the game for "masculine_possessive" under the GENDER set is "GENDER_masculine_possessive"

Strings inside the value attributes will be additionally processed by Unity's rich text markup (see reference here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ugui@1.0/manual/StyledText.html) 

Some strings will use special variables in the form of $VARIABLENAME, these are not universal and only apply to the specific string in which they are used. They are used to
mark placeholders for values that need to be determined within the code based on the current game state -->
